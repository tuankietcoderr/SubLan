00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:15,000
Music

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,000
It was just two levels, sitting in the car, listening to the blonde falling for each other

3
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Picking on skies, feeling super childish, no Donald Glovel

4
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
We score for my mother, like where you at tonight, I know I love her, I was all alone

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:40,000
With the love of my life, she's got glitter for skin, my Brady and baby in the night

6
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:50,000
I don't need no light to see you shine

7
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:05,000
It's your golden honor, you're so down to earth

8
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:22,000
We were just two levels, feet upon the dash, driving over fast, burning through the summer

9
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Brady won't blouse, make the moment last, she got solar power, minutes feel like I was

10
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:35,000
She knew she was about to skin you, even imagine falling like I did for the love of my life

11
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:45,000
She's got blown her face, so glorious looking at eyes, my angel light

12
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:57,000
I was all alone with the love of my life, she's got glitter for skin, my Brady and baby in the night

13
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:06,000
I don't need no light to see you shine

14
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:23,000
It's your golden honor, you're so down to earth

15
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't need no light to see you shine

16
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:03,000
It's your golden honor, you're so down to earth

17
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
you
